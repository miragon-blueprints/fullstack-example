# Documentation

Deeper context that the [README](../README.md) deliberately leaves out — the *why* behind the repo's
shape. This folder holds the **Architecture Decision Records** (the decisions) and the **diagrams**.

An ADR captures a **decision** — dated, numbered, and effectively immutable once accepted (a reversal
gets a new ADR, not an edit). Procedures are not decisions, so they live elsewhere: setup, the ports,
the dev loop and the smoke test in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md); the day-to-day workflow and
the skills in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Where a procedure has a decision behind it, that reasoning is
in the relevant ADR's own Decision section (e.g. the contract flow in ADR-0004, the mutation gate in
ADR-0006).

## Architecture Decision Records

Each non-obvious decision is recorded as an ADR in [`adr/`](adr/), in a MADR/Nygard-lite format
(Status · Context · Decision · Consequences). They are numbered from 0001, never renumbered, and
copied from [`adr/0000-adr-template.md`](adr/0000-adr-template.md). Write a new one with the
`create-adr` skill.
