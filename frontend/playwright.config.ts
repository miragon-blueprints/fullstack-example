 * End-to-end tests live in ./e2e and drive the real React app against a running backend + engine.
 * They sit inside the frontend package so Node resolves @playwright/test from frontend/node_modules.
 * Ports here must agree with the README / AGENTS.md port table: Vite 5173, backend 8080.
 * The dev server is started by CI (or locally) before `npm run e2e`; set PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL to override.
